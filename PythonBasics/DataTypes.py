'''no need to declare any type of variable, it is Dynamically Typed Language:
Python is a dynamically-typed language. That means the type (for example- int, double, long, etc.) for a
variable is decided at run time not in advance because of this feature we donâ€™t need to specify the type of variable.
the variable can be changed at any time further
